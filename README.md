# Brother DCP-9020 CDW printer drivers for Arch Linux

This printer drivers are packaged with makepkg following [the tutorial on how to bundle a Brother printer driver for Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Packaging_Brother_printer_drivers). As this printer's niche, I might not post it on AUR except if there is an explicit demand for it.

I might work on the scanner drivers some time, but that requires me to delve deeper into the inner workings of building an AUR package from a DEB package. Since I might not use that printer in the future, I could find the drivers useless.
